I have worked as an offshore team leader (team of 7 associates) in a USA based client project at Capgemini Hyderabad.

Democratic, as I believe in strict rules and regulations but want to give partial control to the subordinates for carrying out tasks and decision-making process. It also includes distributing responsibility within the group or organization and helps in empowering members.

To get more leadership experience and learn from the professors of one of the best institutes of the country.
